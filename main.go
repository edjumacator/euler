/* Problem 896: A range of integers is a range of numbers that is divisible by a given number.

- A contiguous range of positive integers is called a divisible range if all the integers in the range can be arranged in a row such that the -th
term is a multiple of of n.

	- For example, the range [6..9] is a divisible range because we can arrange the numbers as [7, 6, 9, 8]
	is a divisible range because we can arrange the numbers as

	- In fact, it is the 4th divisible range of length of 4, the first three being [1..4], [2..5], and [3..6].
